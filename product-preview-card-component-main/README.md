## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this as a refresher back into html/css as I hadn't coded a lot recently. I completed a full-stack web development course over a year ago, but ended up finding a product position where those skills were not required on a day-to-day basis. I don't want them to lapse completely, so I've decided to do FE-mentor when I can to refresh myself. I'm looking forward to tackling more complicated builds in the future.
