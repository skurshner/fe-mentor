## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I was a bit rusty working with Javascript and DOM manipulation. This was a pretty basic example but was a good way to shake off some of the dust. The original code that I wrote worked, but I knew it wasn't the optimal solution. I actually utilized ChatGPT to help me refactor the code and simplify it. Such a cool resource!

I added an error state for when a user doesn't select a rating but tries to submit. This wasn't in the designs but I felt it was necessary for good UX. There are a number of ways I could have done this, but decided to use helper text under the button. I could also imagine using a tooltip or another kind of alert.
